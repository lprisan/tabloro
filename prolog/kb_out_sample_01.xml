  "fake typical response structure"
  This is an example of the data structure the KB returns
  from a call to semantic_check.
  Suppose the users have placed in 1st column, upper rows:
  - a "Pyramid I" technique card (slot C1-CSW)
  - a "Study" task card (slot C1-ABA-CSS-TASK)
  - an "Individual learner" team card (slot C1-ABA-CSS-TEAM)
  - a "Forum" card (slot C1-ABA-CSS-TEC1)
  - a "Text editor" card (slot C1-ABA-CSS-TEC2)
  The board complies with the semantic rules of the KB, so the
  <inconsistent-cards> section of the response is empty.
  The board is incomplete because the second task of Pyramid I
  is missing, as well as the whole 2nd phase of the technique.
  The detected missing cards are:
  - a "Solve a problem" OR a "Prepare a list of questions"
    task card in 1st column, lower row (slot C1-ABB-CSS-TASK);
    the associated team and technology cards are not reported
    to the users.
  - a "Pyramid II" technique card in 2nd column (slot C2-CSW)
  As no "?" cards were present in the board status, the
  <suggested-cards> section is empty.
